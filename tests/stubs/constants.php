/**
 * The constants send4.php defines at runtime, for static analysis only.

 * PHPStan analyses each file on its own, so the constants the plugin bootstrap
 * defines are invisible to it. Declaring them here is what stops every use of
 * SEND4_PLUGIN_DIR reading as an undefined constant.
 *
 * SEND4_API_BASE_URL is deliberately absent: its value is environment-specific,
 * so phpstan.neon.dist lists it under dynamicConstantNames instead. Pinning a
 * value here would make Send4_Settings' "is it overridden?" checks look like
 * dead code.
